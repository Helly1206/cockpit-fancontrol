cockpit-fancontrol v0.8.0

cockpit-fancontrol -- cockpit UI for FanControl
================== == ======= == === ==========

This plugin not heavily documented yet, but that is probably not necessary. It's a cockpit UI to use and
configure FanControl (linux package to control systme fans) from a web UI.

It uses cockpit-stdplgin as standard look and feel for this UI.

All settings be configured and current status can be read out.

That's all for now ...
